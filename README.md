Makeblock robot project for logistics trial

The package consists of the software (firmware and source code), deployment instructions (structure assembly instruction and delopment instructions).

Note for unit module:

Servo:
1. Change the wire connection to change the turn direction of servo motor
2. Check the wire connection when motor is in unstable working state
3. "Turning around" and "lifting up" need more speed to get the same effects as "straight forward" or "lifting down"
